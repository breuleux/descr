`descr`: a pretty-printing package
==================================

* Pretty-prints Python structures as HTML+CSS in the IPython Notebook
  or [Terminus](https://github.com/breuleux/terminus).

  * I'll add one for the terminal soon enough, it's just less amusing
    to work on, and quite a lot more limited.

* Basic datatypes, tuple, lists, dictionaries, sets, tracebacks.

* Highlighting of parts using selectors.

* Customizable and extensible.
