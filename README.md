`descr`: a pretty-printing package
==================================

Features
========

* Pretty-prints Python structures as HTML+CSS in the IPython Notebook
  or [Terminus](https://github.com/breuleux/terminus).
  * I'll add one for the terminal soon enough, it's just less amusing
    to work on, and quite a lot more limited.
* Basic datatypes, tuple, lists, dictionaries, sets, tracebacks.
* Highlighting of parts using selectors.
* Customizable and extensible.


Installing
==========

`pip install descr`


IPython tutorials
=================

Pre-made IPython notebooks are available
[here](https://github.com/breuleux/descr/tree/master/examples/notebooks). You
can simply run `ipython notebook` in the directory.

You can also view the results directly:

* [Tour](http://breuleux.github.io/descr/notebook/tour.html)
  showing off important capabilities.
* [Documentation](http://breuleux.github.io/descr/notebook/rules.html) of the
  rules that can be used to manipulate the output.
* Survey of available methods to [inspect](http://breuleux.github.io/descr/notebook/inspect.html) the system.
